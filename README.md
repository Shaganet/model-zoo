Welcome to my personal circus of algorithms! 🎪

Step right up — where models perform, data dances, and overfitting is the greatest tragedy of all.


 ##  the-unknown🌌
There are models here that assume that there will be something here that cannot be classified.

This is where my "tame" linear regression models live. These models walk the fine line between bias and variance — one misstep, and *splash* into the sea of error.
