# model-zoo
Welcome to my personal circus of algorithms! 🎪

Step right up — where models perform, data dances, and overfitting is the greatest tragedy of all.


## > the-unknown🌌
There will be something here that cannot be classified.

This is where my "tame" linear regression models live. These models walk the fine line between bias and variance — one misstep, and *splash* into the sea of error.

> 💡 This is the **main tent** of my machine learning journey — where every model has its moment under the spotlight.

## 🌌 the-unknown
A realm beyond labels.  
Here live the models that **don’t classify** — they **predict, balance, cluster, and dream**.  
No categories. No boundaries. Just pure, unlabelled magic.

This is where my "tame" linear regression models live — the high-wire artists of the ML world.  
They walk the fine line between bias and variance. One misstep, and *splash* — into the sea of error.
