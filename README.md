**Welcome to my personal circus of algorithms! 🎪**

Step right up — where models perform, data dances, and overfitting is the greatest tragedy of all.

# the-unknown🌌
Something that cannot be classified.

* ## tightrope-regressors🤹‍♂️
This is where my "tame" linear regression models live. These models walk the fine line between bias and variance — one misstep, and splash into the sea of error.


* 🌟 **Stars of the Show:**
 
  - **[Scooter Tightrope](the-unknown/tightrope-regressors/scooter_rental.ipynb)** — predicts scooter rental demand, balancing on the edge between weather, season, and chaos. Trained on: **[Scooter Demand Dataset](data-den/day.csv)**  


  - **[The Inventory Equilibrist]()** — Balancing stock levels with grace — one misstep, and the shelves collapse into chaos.  Trained on: **[Retail Inventory Dynamics](data-den/sale_data.csv)**

* ## neighbourhood-navigators🧭
They don’t follow a formula — they walk through the data like ghosts of past decisions, finding patterns in the crowd. One step forward, one glance around — and suddenly, the future is revealed.

  * 🕵️‍♂️ **Whisper from the Shadows:**  
    - **[The Pattern Stalker]()** — It doesn’t predict — it listens. To the silence between sales, to the echo of promotions, to the hum of competitor prices. When the data speaks, it hears. Trained on: **[Retail Inventory Dynamics](data-den/sale_data.csv)**

# classification⚖️
Here, models learn to tell cats from dogs, moods from faces, risks from records. Every decision is a boundary. Every misstep — a misclassification in the spotlight.

* ## logistic-lanterns🕯️
They draw straight lines in feature space and say: "Here, the world divides."Fragile in complexity, yet noble in simplicity.


* 🔮 **Spotlight on the Threshold:**  
  - **[The Yes/No Oracle](classification/logistic-lanterns/Forecasting_the_loan_status.ipynb)** - predicts whether your loan will be approved — based on income, history, and financial footprint. Trained on: **[Loan Applicant Records](data-den/loan_data.csv)**

# sight-spectacle👁️
Where models open their digital eyes for the first time. From blurry pixels to clear forms, the journey begins here.


* 🔭 **Spotlight on Vision:**
  
  - **[The geometry of life](sight-spectacle/the_first_microbe.ipynb)** — segments and analyzes the shape of single-celled organisms, identifying contours and surface area. Processing: **[A party of protozoa](simplest-beasts/Par0.jpg)**
