**Welcome to my personal circus of algorithms! 🎪**

Step right up — where models perform, data dances, and overfitting is the greatest tragedy of all.

# the-unknown🌌
Something that cannot be classified.

* ## tightrope-regressors🤹‍♂️
This is where my "tame" linear regression models live. These models walk the fine line between bias and variance — one misstep, and splash into the sea of error.


* 🌟 **Star of the Show:**
 
  - **[Scooter Tightrope](model-zoo/the-unknown🌌/tightrope-regressors🤹‍♂️/scooter_rental.ipynb)** — predicts scooter rental demand, balancing on the edge between weather, season, and chaos. 
Trained on: **[Scooter Demand Dataset](data-den🕳️/day.csv)**  


# classification⚖️


* ## logistic-lanterns🕯️
They draw straight lines in feature space and say: *"Here, the world divides."*  
Fragile in complexity, yet noble in simplicity.


* 🌟 **Spotlight on the Threshold:**  
  - **[The Yes/No Oracle](model-zoo/classification⚖️/logistic-lanterns🕯️/)**  
    
    Trained on: **[Loan Applicant Records](data-den🕳️/loan_data.csv)**  
    
→ Act I: Regression | Act II: Classification | Act III: Vision →

# sight-spectacle👁️
Where models open their digital eyes for the first time.  
From blurry pixels to clear forms, the journey begins here.


* 🔭 **Spotlight on Vision:**
  
  - **[The geometry of life](model-zoo/sight-spectacle👁️/the_first_microbe.ipynb)** — segments and analyzes the shape of single-celled organisms, identifying contours and surface area.
Trained on: **[A party of protozoa](model-zoo/simplest-beasts🦠/IM0.jpg)**
