**Welcome to my personal circus of algorithms! 🎪**

Step right up — where models perform, data dances, and overfitting is the greatest tragedy of all.

#  the-unknown🌌
Something that cannot be classified.

* ## tightrope-regressors🤹‍♂️
This is where my "tame" linear regression models live. These models walk the fine line between bias and variance — one misstep, and splash into the sea of error.

  - **[Scooter Tightrope](model-zoo/the-unknown🌌/tightrope-regressors🤹‍♂️/scooter_rental.ipynb)**
   
  -  Trained on: **[Scooter Demand Dataset](data-den🕳️/day.csv)**  


# sight-spectacle👁️
Where models open their digital eyes for the first time.  
From blurry pixels to clear forms, the journey begins here.


*  **Spotlight on Vision:**
  - **[The geometry of life](model-zoo/sight-spectacle👁️/the_first_microbe.ipynb)**
     Trained on: **[A party of protozoa](model-zoo/simplest-beasts🦠/IM0.jpg)**
    
A simple image of protists, but for the model it is a whole universe of shapes, facets and meaning.
